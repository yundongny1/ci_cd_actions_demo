# CI/CD Actions

This repository contains testing CI/CD workflows using Github Actions. It uses a sample bash script to trigger the python script that will check if the python dependencies were properly installed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CI/CD actions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yundongny1/ci_cd_actions_demo.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd ci_cd_actions
    ```
3. Run the hello_world script just to check you can run a script.
    ```
    ./hello_world.sh
    ```
4. When you push to your own github repository, Github will trigger the workflow. You can make changes to scripts as you seem fit.
